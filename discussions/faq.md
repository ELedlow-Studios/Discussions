### 6. If I modify or reverse-engineer the source code of a game engine, package, or release, can I distribute it?
Depends on the license and creators. 90% of the time, we will allow this as we are an open-source organization after all. However, some of our projects are in collaboration with The Web-Breakout Team, which is not an open-source organization or team. We will include most of the free-to-use source code in the repository so that you can use the content we have permission to distribute. However, once it is bundled with copyrighted content (like in the releases, for example), it is not allowed as it violates the license(s) we have applied to it.
